# capstone practice,  Contact Manager.
Deploy link: https://contactmanager-6a1fc.web.app/

This app allows the creation of a user or logging in as a user. Each user can create a contact list entry. Each contact list is unique to the user
who created it and no other user can see another users contact list unless they log in as that user. The user and contact list data persists in a 
Spring boot Java and postgres backend. Currently to log out, refresh the page.
